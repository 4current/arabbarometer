For the subject of my application, I took a wild stab by googling datasets first. Then came across [the ARDA](http://www.thearda.com/) (Association of Religious Data Archives). So I stopped there and thought I'd do a little exploritory analysis to see what I could come up with.

After downloading the survey questions, I decided that a good question to ask would be whether or not I could predict which individual would be an internet user based on the country and groomed data, these are: Age, Education, Employment, Gender, Marital Status, Religion. The Explore tab above represents the bulk of this application.

Working on the prediction (labeled Application) is only started, but it indicates the next step of this project. From the Rubric, I believe I have completed the the requirements within the scope of this project.
